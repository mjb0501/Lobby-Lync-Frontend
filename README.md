## 📌 About the Project

This project was built entirely by myself over the course of several months.  Before I began this project I had very limited experience with building full-stack applications having only built very simple applications.  As such, this project was my attempt at pushing myself to see what I could accomplish on my own.  For this project I had to teach myself, using online resources, SQL (Postgres), Docker, Linux Server Architecture, WebSockets, unit and integration testing, CI/CD principles (Github Actions), cybersecurity principles, and much more.  As of right now the site is live and can be found with the link listed above.  I plan on continuing development of this project for the foreseeable future and would love for you to take a look and mess around with it.  If you happen to find any bugs or think of any features you would love to see added please feel free to use the link below to do so.
